As a VoIP engineer, I reliably operated a carrier-grade VoIP switching system serving over 600,000 subscribers, along with its associated infrastructure.  
My responsibilities included establishing operational procedures, improving network architecture, troubleshooting and enabling new services through subscriber switch upgrades.
At times, I used Python to automate tasks such as provisioning large volumes of user information via API calls using the requests module, or managing servers with SSH access through automation using the paramiko module.

### 2014/04_Recovery from the fire damage at the Samsung SDS Gwacheon Data Center
[News Link : Data Center Fire Leads to Outage for Samsung Devices]([https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20140420062851061](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/outages/data-center-fire-leads-to-outage-for-samsung-devices)

Due to the fire, all equipment was damaged, and operations were shifted to the **cold site for disaster recovery**.  
The recovery process involved server provisioning, operating system installation, application deployment, and database restoration.

### 2015/10_Expansion contact center agent capacity for S Comapny  North America branch 

I managed the SIP call server and the session border controller (SBC), and was involved in network architecture design.

By utilizing Radware's ADC AppShape functionality for SIP and Oracle SBC's HMR (Header Manipulation Rule) feature, we were able to **real-time** insert an international call indicator into the caller ID for calls originating from overseas IPs to domestic destinations.

### 2021/10_SIP Call Server Virtualization Migration

Migrated the BroadWorks platform from legacy bare-metal servers to a virtualized server environment.

### 2022/12_Migration from Cisco GSS to AWS Route 53

Deploy a portal accessible worldwide useing CDN and AWS multi-region deployment. Using AWS Route 53 geoproximity routing.(GSLB)

### 2024/10_Automated processing and upload of PII data using Powershell
